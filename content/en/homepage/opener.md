Alpujarra Brothers are a group of men who have come together to build trust and comradeship with the aim of modelling healthy male behaviour.\
We meet up on a weekly basis to support each other in order to support the community.\
Part of the New Mankind movement, we are inspired by and modelled on ‘A Band of Brothers’ (ABOB), a UK charity.

**Saving the world one man at a time**

In the UK ABOB support men of all ages, all walks of life and all over the country, through mentoring, initiations and weekly meetings of local groups.\
ABOB also works with the probation service and is extremely successful in helping troubled young men to turn their lives around.

Here in Spain, the Alpujarra Brothers have been meeting since 2018.\
We work together at becoming the men we want to be: emotionally balanced and mature, capable of looking after ourselves and others, men of honour and integrity.\
We strive to be better fathers, better partners, better friends, but above all better men.

**Healthy men for a healthy society**

We are now in a position to offer our services to the local community.\
At this point this is restricted to the English speaking community and men of age but in the longer term we want to grow into running a Spanish language group as well as reaching out to teenage boys.\
On an individual basis some of our members do so already.\
What we offer is mentoring services for young men, community support and rite of passage/initiation weekends for men of any age.
