#### Why do we need men's groups?

There is a pronounced lack of positive male role models in society as a whole.\
Lonely, angry, selfish, old yet immature men are somehow in charge of running countries, corporations and cultural institutions and the result is a disaster.\
Greed overrules cooperation, short term thinking is put before the consideration of future generations.\
Violence and war are accepted as being legitimate and representative of human nature.\
What we think of as the ‘normal’ state of affairs is really an imbalance.\
Destruction and aggression rather than nurturing and caring are found in society as a whole as well as in the personalities of many individual men.\
Whilst it would be oversimplifying to link all the wrongs of the world to Imbalanced masculinity, healing men might yet proove to be one of the most effective tools in saving the world.

As it stands it is very difficult for anyone to see a way forward in this overly complex dog-eat-dog world.\
But young men especially lack guidance.\
There are very few good, loving and capable male role models in the public sphere.\
Healthy men are hard to find.

On a local level in the Alpujarras, many of us have come here to rediscover community, a simpler life and quite possibly aspects of a more traditional life.\
The irony is that for some of our young men being torn away from their country, a parent, wider family, friends, and/or a familiar cultural context can be quite isolating.\
There is also a very high proportion of children with no father figure present, be it physically or emotionally.

The Alpujarra Brothers seek to offer guidance, support and hope to young men locally.\
We are also a solid community of men that others can join.

#### Imbalanced masculinity

*Men are incapable of dealing with their emotions*

Even though this is clearly a false belief, in practise it too often seems to be proven right.\
In many male peer groups emotionally open men are looked down upon.\
Many of us were actually taught to suppress emotions and often it seems to be the safe thing to do.\
But it’s not.

*Avoiding grief, anger or fear means losing out on joy too.*

And what is not felt often comes to the surface in damaging ways: toxic behaviour, aggression, addiction and/or ill health.\
This has terrible consequences for the men in question, their loved ones and society as a whole.

> The uninitiated man will burn down the village just to feel its warmth.

African proverb

So, on the one side, there are men who are aggresive, self-centred, violent and/or sexual predators.\
On the other end of the spectrum are men who are unable to assert themselves, afraid of their own masculinity, unable to stand-up for themselevs or others.\
The latter are often "nice guys" but, unfortunately, nice guys with no backbone will not stop their aggresive counterparts from burning down the village.

But this does not need to be a world of either wolf or sheep.\
When men learn to feel their grief, to transform anger and to overcome fear, they become kind and capable men.
